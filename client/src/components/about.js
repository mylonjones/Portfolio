        My name is Mylon Jones. I am a Software Engineer specializing in full-stack web development. I like software engineering because of the innumerable uses which can, and do, improve life in countless ways. I want to use my software engineering skills to make the world more interactive.

        I am experienced and comfortable with working alone, pair-programming, and team collaboration. Among my various other projects, I recently collaborated with a team of four engineers to design and build a full-stack web application that keeps track of vehicle maintenance using React, Express, and MongoDB. My philosophy is to do my job as if I were doing it for myself or do it better. I don’t just stop when I finish the basic tasks, I look to see if there is anything more I can do.

        I aim to find a workplace where I can use creativity and problem solving to build interactive tools and applications that are ethical, valuable, and diverse. I would be in a dynamic team of results-driven engineers whom I could hang out with outside of work on occasion. It would also be ideal to someday be a mentor because I want to be helpful to my fellow engineers as much as I can.

        Aside from these things, I am an amateur classical violinist and pianist and I perform with my local community orchestra. Some of my favorite composers are Debussy, Dvořák, and Stravinsky.
