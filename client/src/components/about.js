      My name is Mylon Jones. I am a Software Engineer specializing in full-stack web development. I became a software engineering because of the countless ways it can improve the world. I want to use my software engineering skills to make the world more interactive.

      I am experienced and work comfortably alone, pair-programming, and in team collaboration. Among my various projects, I recently collaborated with a team of four engineers to design and build a full-stack web application that keeps track of vehicle maintenance using React, Express, and MongoDB. My philosophy is to do my job as well as I can, doing whatever it takes. I like to do as much as I can on my own, but when I reach a blocker I cannot overcome, I will reach out for guidance. I don’t just stop when I finish the basic tasks. I look to see if there is anything more that I can do.

      I aim to find a workplace where I can use creativity and problem solving to build diverse, ethical, and valuable tools and applications. I would be in a dynamic team of results-driven engineers whom I could hang out with outside of work on occasion. I would also like to be a mentor someday because I love sharing my knowledge and being as helpful to my fellow engineers as I can.

      Aside from these things, I am an amateur classical violinist and pianist, and I perform with my local community orchestra. Some of my favorite composers are Debussy, Dvořák, and Stravinsky.
