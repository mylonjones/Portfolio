        I am a software engineer and a graduate of Hack Reactor, an immersive software engineering

        boot-camp, where I gained hundreds of hours of experience programming and collaborating.

        My experience includes the development of several full-stack web-apps in collaborative team
        environments while applying Agile software development methods including peer reviews and
        daily stand-ups. On one project I took the leading role over three other engineers where we
        created a functional web-app in one week. My responsibilities were to generate requirements,
        keep the team goal oriented, and develop the system interface. Most of my programming
        experience is developing software in JavaScript and using Git for configuration management,
        but I also have some experience with C and Java.

        I have taken a few programming courses at community college and I am currently progressing towards a degree in Computer Science.
